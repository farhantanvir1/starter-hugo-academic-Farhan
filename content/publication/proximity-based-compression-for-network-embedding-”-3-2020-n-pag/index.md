abstract: "Network embedding that encodes structural information of graphs into
  a low-dimensional vector space has been proven to be essential for network
  analysis applications, including node classification and community detection.
  Although recent methods show promising performance for various applications,
  graph embedding still has some challenges; either the huge size of graphs may
  hinder a direct application of the existing network embedding method to them,
  or they suffer compromises in accuracy from locality and noise. In this paper,
  we propose a novel Network Embedding method, NECL, to generate embedding more
  efficiently or effectively. Our goal is to answer the following two questions:
  1) Does the network Compression significantly boost Learning? 2) Does network
  compression improve the quality of the representation? For these goals, first,
  we propose a novel graph compression method based on the neighborhood
  similarity that compresses the input graph to a smaller graph with
  incorporating local proximity of its vertices into super-nodes; second, we
  employ the compressed graph for network embedding instead of the original
  large graph to bring down the embedding cost and also to capture the global
  structure of the original graph; third, we refine the embeddings from the
  compressed graph to the original graph."

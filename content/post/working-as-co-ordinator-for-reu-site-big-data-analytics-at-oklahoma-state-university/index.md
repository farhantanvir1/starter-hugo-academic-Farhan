I have the opportunity to co-ordinate the program for **REU Site: Big Data Analytics at Oklahoma State University.** I hold daily meetings with 10 undergraduate students from 5 different universities, keeping track of their progress and helping them out in their projects. Moreover, I am actively involved in undergraduate students' projects.

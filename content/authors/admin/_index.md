I am currently a third-year CS PhD candidate in [Department of Computer Science](https://computerscience.okstate.edu/) at [Oklahoma State University](https://go.okstate.edu/). I have the fortune to be advised by Prof. [Esra Akbas](https://www.cs.okstate.edu/~eakbas/). Before coming to OSU, I graduated in 2015 from Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh.

My research mainly focus on graph mining, with their applications in Bioinformatics/Computational Biomedicine.

<p>
I am serving as a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Georgia State University. I have completed PhD in CS from <a target="_blank" href="https://computerscience.okstate.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a target="_blank" href="https://go.okstate.edu/">Oklahoma State University.</a> I had the pleasure to be advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/esra-akbas/">Prof. Esra Akbas</a>. Before coming to OSU, I graduated in 2015 from <a target="_blank" href="https://cse.iutoic-dhaka.edu">Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh</a>.

My research mainly focus on graph mining, with their applications in Bioinformatics/Computational Biomedicine.
